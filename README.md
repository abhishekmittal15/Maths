# Algebra-and-Analysis
On Elementary Algebra, Analysis, Probability and Statistics.

This is supposed to contain stuff regarding Abstract Algebra (follow Artin :P), Linear Algebra (Strang :3), Probability (don't we like how precise Tsitsiklis is) and Statistics (I have no "I like this book" for this).
